# CoStar Data Coverage Checklist

**Purpose:** Quick reference for admins to know what data auto-fills from CoStar vs what needs manual entry.

---

## Auto-Fill from CoStar PDF (✅)

These fields are automatically populated when you run the Docling extraction on a CoStar property report.

The runtime preflights each new report independently and sends only the leading
pages needed to complete the subject-property section. The two checked-in
sample reports complete on page 5; shifted layouts can continue through page
10 without processing the report appendices.

### Scorecard Inputs

The lightweight native-text pass also auto-fills these score factors from their
demographic-summary and submarket-overview pages without sending those pages
through Docling:

- 3-mile population, population growth, median household income, and median
  home value
- Submarket vacancy, delivered units as a percentage of inventory, and units
  under construction as a percentage of inventory

Renter-household share, crime, schools, walk, and transit are not present in the
checked-in reports and remain reference/manual inputs.

## Workflow Recommendation

1. **Start with CoStar PDF extraction** - Get basic property data and unit mix
2. **Request CoStar Analytics export** - Get demographics and submarket data
3. **Obtain OM from broker** - Get T12 financials and seller information
4. **Research third-party sources** - Crime, schools, walk scores
5. **Develop business plan** - CapEx budget, growth assumptions
6. **Input deal terms** - Loan structure, equity split, exit assumptions
7. **Review calculated outputs** - Verify formulas are working correctly
